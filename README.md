# MerekaHack - Ecobuddy

A React-powered platform bridging the "intention-action gap" in urban sustainability. Features Gemini AI for food rescue "Surprise Boxes," AI container verification to cut plastic, and a gamified "Eco-Mirror" digital pet. Driving real SDG 11, 12, and 13 impact through verified green habits.

🌿 **EcoBuddy**

Zero-Friction Sustainability via AI-Verified Action and Emotional Gamification.

EcoBuddy is a mobile application developed for KitaHack 2026 that bridges the "intention-action gap" in urban sustainability. Unlike traditional apps that rely on the "honor system," EcoBuddy uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to physically verify green actions before rewarding users.

🚀 **The Problem & Our Solution**
We address the specific challenges faced by urban citizens and F&B merchants:

Rampant Food Waste: Malaysia generates 17,000 tonnes of food waste daily; 24% is still edible.
Recycling Contamination: High contamination rates render collected materials unrecyclable.
Carbon Emissions: Heavy reliance on private vehicles for short urban errands (under 3km).
Our Unique Selling Proposition (USP): We shift from "self-reporting" to AI-Verified Compliance using multimodal vision and real-time spatial reasoning.

🎯 **SDG Alignment**
SDG 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities – Promoting sustainable transport (Target 11.2) and reducing urban waste impact (Target 11.6).
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption & Production – Halving retail food waste (Target 12.3) and substantially reducing waste through prevention and reuse (Target 12.5).
SDG 13: Climate Action – Improving climate education and awareness through tangible impact metrics (Target 13.3).

✨ **Key Features**
Bento 1. Leftover Food (Surprise Box)
Merchant Efficiency: Merchants list "Surprise Boxes" by category and quantity in under 15 seconds.
AI Urgency: Gemini AI automatically assesses food risk (e.g., tagging Sushi as "CRITICAL URGENCY") to nudge nearby users for immediate rescue.

Camera 2. BYO Container AI Lock
Verification Gatekeeper: The checkout button is physically locked until the Gemini Vision AI scans and verifies a reusable container in the camera frame.
Volume Estimation: AI estimates the meal volume to ensure the user's container is the correct size.

Sprout 3. The Eco-Mirror (Digital Pet)
Emotional Accountability: Your actions reflect in your pet's room.
The Penalty: Using single-use plastic triggers a "foggy/dirty" room state for 3 days, creating a psychological deterrent against waste.

Walking 4. Green Mobility & Recycling Detector
Green Mobility: Detects short commutes via Google Maps API and nudges users to walk, calculating real-time CO₂ savings.
Recycling Detector: AI-verified object detection ensures only correct materials enter municipal recycling streams.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
Frontend: React Native (Modular architecture)
AI Engine: Google AI Studio & Gemini 1.5 Flash (Multimodal Vision & Reasoning)
Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
Geolocation: Google Maps API
